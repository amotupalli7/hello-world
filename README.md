When I think of math puzzles in CICS or computing I think of puzzles that involve some sort of algorithmic thinking or techniques of solving. The path to the solution can be ordered step by step and can be made into a repeatable process that can be shared with others.
 
## A Puzzle I Like

One puzzle I personally enjoy is the rubicks cube. I have different types of cubes from 2x2 to 3x3 to 4x4. However, I never tried to figure out how to actually solve it myself I just turned to the internet for already solved algorithms and techniques and now it is muscle memory to solve them.
